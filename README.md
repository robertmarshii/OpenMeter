The Open Meter Mission

81% of hacking-related breaches leveraged stolen or weak passwords. Detecting these vulnerable passwords in web browsers is now possible thanks to advances in neural networking.

Open Meter aims to reduce this percentage by training an artificial intelligent machine to warn users when it detects an extremely weak or leaked password being used.
Most companies attempt to prevent their employees and end-users from registering with weak passwords via password strength meters. Over time, all of our passwords become weaker. Attackers get smarter and computers get faster.

Sometimes an organisation may ask us to update our old password, so how do we respond? We all just add a 1 or a ! to the end to bypass the dumb password policies and restrictions.

Worse still, we all use the same password multiple times on multiple different websites. A lot of the time we have no idea which websites use which passwords. Third party tools remember all of this for us.

So, what happens when one of those websites we registered on gets breached? Our password gets leaked and the computers used to attack our accounts get passed our credentials and we become one of the 81%.

Technology moves quickly but the businesses who use it do not. It is time to stop reacting to hackers and start proactively defending ourselves using the same techniques they do.

Open Meter has been trained on the same datasets that hackers are now using to break into our accounts. Don't become one of the 81%, implement and encourage the use of Open Meter today.
